## When I receive move
Now you've got the costumes changing the way you want them to on the first sprite, you can add movement to it.

Let's get the first sprite moving randomly within the stage. Then you can modify your code to make your sprite more more specifically.

--- task ---

Go to the first sprite's Code tab and add the following blocks:

when I receive [move v] :: event
repeat ():: control
glide () sec to [random position v] :: motion

Decide how many times you want the sprite to repeat gliding to a random position and how many seconds you want it to glide for.

Run your program.

**Tip:**: Adjust the values of `repeat`{:class="block3control"} and `seconds`{:class="block3motion"} and run the program until you are happy with the pace of the sprite. It often takes a few attempts to get the animation working in a way that you are happy with.

Tidy up and resize your program within the Code tab. It will be easier to see first sprite's program as it gets longer.

Change the new sprite's costume or edit the costume with the paint editor so that it looks different from your first sprite.

Think about how this sprite will be different to the first sprite. 

How big should the sprite be? 
Which direction will it point in?

Will the sprite appear behind or in front or other sprites?
