## When I receive move
Now that the costumes on the first sprite are switching and you have broadcast the end of the costume sequence you can add movement to the first sprite under a `when I receive`{:class="block3control"} block.

--- task ---
Think about how you want your sprites to move. The sprites need to move in the same way so that the sprite with the surprise is harder to identify.

Look at the Backdrop you have chosen and explore how your sprites might move in relation to it. 

Look at the movement of the sprites in these Same but different projects:

![Complete project](images/same_triplets.gif)
![Complete project](images/same_hens.gif)
![Complete project](images/same_presents.gif)

**Tip:**: Linking a sprite's motion to the backdrop graphic can make your project more realistic.

In the first sprite's Costume tab, make sure the first costume is selected. Now the game will always start with the first costume.

Try out different sprite motion to help you decide which movement is best for your first sprite.

For a reminder of the code required under the `when I receive`{:class="block3control"} block explore the program in the project [Which triplet ate the doughnut?](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/411558897).

--- task ---
Adjust the values of `repeat`{:class="block3control"} and `secs`{:class="block3motion"} and run the program until you are happy with the pace of the sprite. It often takes a few attempts to get a sprite animating in a way that you are happy with.

Run your program.

Instead of a fixed number of seconds, you can vary the speed that the first sprite moves by adding a `variable`{:class="block3variables} called `speed`{:class="block3variables} to the `secs`{:class="block3motion"} block.

You are  going to make a slider for the speed variable so that the user can modify the speed easily when they are playing the game.

You can adapt the `x`{:class="block3motion"} and `y`{:class="block3motion"} coordinates to create more specfic sprite movement.

For example, in [Which triplet ate the doughnut?](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/411558897/editor/), the sprites have a random `x`{:class="block3motion"} value and a fixed `y`{:class="block3motion"} value so that the triplets appear to be gliding along the pavement.

Tidy up and resize your program within the Code tab. It will be easier to see first sprite's program as it gets longer.
