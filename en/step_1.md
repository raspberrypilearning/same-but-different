## Introduction
You’re going to create a fun game to try and improve a user’s concentration and help them focus and relax. You will choose a theme for your project.

## Skills you should have
To complete this Same but different project you need to have the following skills which you will have learnt when completing [Focus on the prize]https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/focus-on-the-prize):
- How to use `broadcasts`{:class="block3control"} to communicate between sprites
- How to detect when two sprites are `touching`{:class="block3sense"} each other
- How to use `and`{:class="block3operators"} and `not`{:class="block3operators"} Boolean operators 

You will now apply these skills to create your own project where you will choose your own sprites and backdrop to create a unique animation.

## What you will make
