## Share your project
Share your project with someone else and act on their feedback.

If you are in a club, why not share your project to friends and peers?

If you are at home, try the project out with your family. 

If you have a Scratch account you can share your project through Scratch. Then you can send a link to people you know and the whole Scratch community will be able to find your project and try it out.

If you have a Scratch account and have shared your Same but different project, keep an eye out for comments that others may make about your creation. Feedback is a great way to reflect on your work. Ignore any comments which are negative or irrelevant.
