## When this sprite clicked

You will now set up another control block, `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3event"}. This block will only run when it has received `false` from the `finished`{:class="block3looks"} variable i.e when the sequence of `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3event"} has run.

You can create more costumes so when the first sprite's is clicked it says something like Yes! (or whatever you want it to) and you can create a costume which looks at the user or looks at the surprise or whatever you want it to! Explore the `say`{:class="block3looks"} and `switch costume`{:class="block3looks"} blocks under `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3event"} in other projects in the [Same but different](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27154226){:target="_blank"} Scratch studio.

**Tip:** Looking at other programs is a great way to get ideas for your unique project.
