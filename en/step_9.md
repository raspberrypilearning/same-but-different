## Reflect on your project
How did you get on with your Looping sprites project? Is there anything you would do differently? 

Remind yourself what you have learned:

--- task ---
I can use if on edge, bounce inside a forever loop to make my sprite turn away from the edge of the stage
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can use a forever loop to make a sprite repeat code 
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can modify a costume in the paint editor
--- /task ---
--- task ---
My  project uses rotation styles to change how my sprite rotates
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can use layers to make it look like some sprites are in front of others
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I found a bug in my code and fixed it
--- /task ---

Demonstrating these skills will contribute to the [Scratch Beginner]() and [Citizen Maker]() badges. 

You can go back and improve your project whenever you have time. 

If you have a Scratch account and have shared your Looping sprites project, keep an eye out for comments that others may make about your creation. Feedback is a great way to reflect on your work. Ignore any comments which are negative or irrelevant.

Share your project

If you are in a club, why not demonstrate your project to friends and peers?

If you are at home, try the project out with your family. 

If you have a Scratch account you can share your project through Scratch. Then you can send a link to people you know and the whole Scratch community will be able to find your project and try it out.

Why not invite your friends to create a project? Let them know how you had fun.

If you have been following along the Skills projects in the Being Mindful pathway then go back to the next Skills project, [Serene Scene](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/serene-scene) and begin to use `variables`{:class="block3variables"} in a program.

If you have completed all the Skills projects in the Look After Yourself pathway and are now following the Make it yours projects, then go on to the next project [Make it yours Project 2 name](Project URL). 

If you want to have more fun exploring Scratch, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch).
