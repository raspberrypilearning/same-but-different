## Variables

You need to set two varibles: speed and finished

## speed 
This variable needs to be ticked in the Blocks area so it appears as a graphic on the Stage. When it is in the Stage, double-click on it until you reach the variable as a slide. The user will now be able to vary the speed they play the game themselves.

**scratch-variable-slider

Add speed as the secs in the `repeat`{:class="block3control"} and `repeat until`{:class="block3control"} blocks.

Add this block under the `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3event"} block

set [speed v] to () :: variables

## finished 

Look inside the project [Focus on the prize](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/focus-on-the-prize) to refresh your memory of varibles.
