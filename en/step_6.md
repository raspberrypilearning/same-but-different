## Variables

You need to set two varibles: speed and finsihed

## speed 
This variable needs to be ticked in the Blocks area so it appears as a graphic on the Stage. When it is in the Stage, double-click on it until you reach the variable as a slide. The user will now be able to vary the speed they play the game themselves.

**scratch-variable-slider

Add speed as the secs in the repeat and the repeat until blocks.
