## More sprites

--- task ---

The second and third sprite need the original first costume only. You can delete the other costumes, if there are any. Make sure all the sprites' first costumes are exactly the same.

Remember to select the Costume tab in the correct sprite that you want to change.

--- /task ---

--- task ---
In the Code tab of the second and third sprites add the following blocks: 
+`when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"}
+`go to`{:class="block3motion"}
+ if needed, a `set size to () %`{:class="block3looks"}

Remember to change the starting position of the second and third sprites so each sprite starts in different position on the Stage.
You will need to make sure that the second and third sprite are the same size as the first sprite.

You now need to copy the whole of the code under `when I receive move`{:class="block3events"} and `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"} over to the second and third sprites.

Now you need to adapt the code that you have copied over.

Make sure you are in the correct sprite's Code tab.

In `when I receive move`{:class="block3events"} change the `motion`{:class="block3motion"} block so the sprites move from the place where you have selected they start from.

--- task ---
In `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"} delete the `switch costume to`{:class="block3motion"} blocks. 
--- /task ---

--- task ---
You only need the second and third sprites to `say`{:class="block3looks"} something. What do you want the second and third sprites to say when they are clicked?

Now think of a distractor ssprite and program its movement across the stage to distract the players as they try to focus on the sprite with the surprise.
