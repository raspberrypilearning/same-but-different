## Create sprites 2 and 3 (as well as the distractor sprite 4)

--- task ---

The second and third sprite only need the original first costume. You can delete the other costumes, if there are any. All the sprites' first costumes should be exactly the same.

Make sure you have selected the Costume tab in the correct sprite that you want to change.

In the Code tab of the second and third sprite  add the following: a `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"}, a `go to`{:class="block3motion"} block and, if needed, a `set size to () %`{:class="block3looks"} block. 

Remember to change the starting position of the second and third sprite so each sprite so they start in diffeent positions on the Stage.
You will need to make sure that the second and third sprite are the same size as the first sprite.

You now need to copy the whole of the code in `when I receive move`{:class="block3events"} and `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"} over to the second and third sprite.

In `when I receive move`{:class="block3events"} change the `motion`{:class="block3motion"} block so the sprites move from the place where you have selected they start from.

In `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"} delete the `switch costume to`{:class="block3motion"} blocks. You only need them to `say`{:class="block3looks"} something. What do you  want the second and third sprites to say if they are clicked?
