## Create sprites 2 and 3 (as well as the distractor sprite 4)

--- task ---

The second and third sprite only need the original first costume. You can delete the other costumes, if there are any. All the sprites' first costumes should be exactly the same.

Make sure you have selected the Costume tab in the correct sprite that you want to change.

In the Code tab of the second and third sprite  add the following: a `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"}, a `go to`{:class="block3motion"} block and, if needed, a `set size to () %`{:class="block3looks"} block. 

Remember to change the starting position of the second and third sprite so each sprite so they start in diffeent positions on the Stage.
You will need to make sure that the second and third sprite are the same size as the first sprite.
