## Variables

--- task ---
You need to set two variables: `speed`{:class="block3variables"} and `finished`{:class="block3variables"}.

**Tip:** Refresh your memory of variables by seeing inside the project [Focus on the prize](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/focus-on-the-prize).

## `speed`{:class="block3variables"}
--- task ---

The `speed`{:class="block3variables"} variable needs to be ticked in the Blocks area so it appears as a graphic on the Stage.

When the `speed`{:class="block3variables"} variable is in the Stage convert it to a slider so the user will now be able to vary the speed themselves as they play the game.

**scratch-variable-slider

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Add the rounded `speed`{:class="block3variables"} variable block to both the `secs`{:class="block3motion"} values.

**scratch-addvariablestosecs

Changing the value `1` will alter the `speed`{:class="block3variables"}. The higher the value, the faster the sprites will move.

--- /task ---

## `finished`{:class="block3variables"}

--- task ---

Create a variable called `finished`{:class="block3variables"}.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

You will now `set finished to`{:class="block3variables"} the Boolean value of `true` and `set finished to`{:class="block3variables"} the Boolean value of `false`. 

**scratch-variablessettrueandfalsevalues

In the next step you will use the `set finished to`{:class="block3variables"} of `false` to create a condition so all the sprites run the next stage of their program.
