## Variables

--- task ---
You need to set two variables: `speed`{:class="block3variables"} and `finished`{:class="block3variables"}.

**Tip:** Refresh your memory of variables by seeing inside the project [Focus on the prize](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/focus-on-the-prize).

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Create a variable called `finished`{:class="block3variables"}.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

The `speed`{:class="block3variables"} variable needs to be ticked in the Blocks area so it appears as a graphic on the Stage. 

**scratch-variable-stage

--- /task ---

--- task ---

When the `speed`{:class="block3variables"} variable shows in the Stage, convert it to a slider so the player will be able to vary the speed that the sprites move themselves when they play the game.

**scratch-variable-slider

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Add the rounded `speed`{:class="block3variables"} variable block to both the `secs`{:class="block3motion"} values.

**scratch-addvariablestosecs

Changing the value `1` will alter the `speed`{:class="block3variables"}. The higher the value, the faster the sprites will move, the greater the challenge.

--- /task ---

## `finished`{:class="block3variables"}

--- task ---

Create a variable called `finished`{:class="block3variables"}.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

You will now creat two blocks: 
+`set finished to`{:class="block3variables"} with the Boolean value of `true`. 
+`set finished to`{:class="block3variables"} with the Boolean value of `false`.

Investigate other example programs in the [Same but different](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27154226){:target="_blank"} Scratch studio to see where these blocks should go under `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"}.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

In the Code tab, set up another control block `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"}. This block will only run when it has received the condition `set finished to`{:class="block3variables"} `false` i.e when the sequence of `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} has run. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Again, explore the `say`{:class="block3looks"} and `switch costume`{:class="block3looks"} blocks under `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"} in other projects in the [Same but different](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/27154226){:target="_blank"} Scratch studio.

**Tip:** Looking at other programs is a great way to get ideas for your own unique project.

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Now  make the sprite with the surprise say something when it is clicked. What do you want it to say? 

**Tip:** Remember, even if you click the sprite it won't say anything until `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} and `when I receive move `{:class="block3events"} have finished running.
