## Reflect on your project

How did you get on with your Looping sprites project? Is there anything you would do differently? 

Remind yourself what you have learned:

I can use if on edge, bounce inside a forever loop to make my sprite turn away from the edge of the stage

--- task ---
I can use a forever loop to make a sprite repeat code 
--- /task ---
--- task ---

My  project uses rotation styles to change how my sprite rotates
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can use layers to make it look like some sprites are in front of others
--- /task ---
--- task ---

Demonstrating these skills will contribute to the [Scratch Beginner]() and [Citizen Maker]() badges. 

You can go back and improve your project whenever you have time.
