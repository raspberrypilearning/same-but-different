## What Next?

If you have completed all the Skills and Challenge projects in the Look After Yourself learning journey you should now go on to the Independent project [Digital Card](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/digital-card) where you will utilise your breadth of skills and increased independence to create your very own project.

If you want to have more fun exploring Scratch, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch).
