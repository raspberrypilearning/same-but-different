## Choose your theme

Now it's time to start thinking about the theme of your own project and how it will look.

--- task ---

Open a [new Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor){:target=”_blank”}, to look at the range of sprites and backgrounds, and take 5 minutes to think about **your** Same but different project. 

+ Will your game be set in a certain place, or have some kind of pattern background?
+ Look at the sprites and backdrops that are available in Scratch.
+ Which backdrop will you choose? 
+ Which sprites will you choose? Will you choose sprites that alreay have costumes or will you create your own costumes?

Choose and add a backdrop of your choice. You can change it later as you develop your idea.

Choose and add your first sprite.

[[[generic-scratch-sprite-from-library]]]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Give your project a title that matches your theme. 

**generic-scratch-title with gif**

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Copy your first sprite twice so you have three sprites which look the same.

**Add:scratch-copy&rename-sprite**

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Rename the sprites. For example, ChosenName1, ChosenName2, ChosenName3.

**Tip:** Naming and numbering your sprites for Same but different will be a good way for you, and others, to recognise which sprite is which as well as the order you may want them to show.
