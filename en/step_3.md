## Choose your theme

Now it's time to think about your project. You need to make a Same but different game to focus the mind. The theme, sprites and costumes are up to you.



--- task ---
Take 5 minutes to think about **your** Same but different project. 

+ What Same but different project do you want to create?
+ Look at the sprites and backdrops that are available in Scratch.
+ Which backdrop will you choose? 
+ Which sprite(s) will you choose? Will you choose sprites that alreay have costumes or will you create your own costumes?

--- task ---
Choose and add a backdrop of your choice. You can change it later as you develop your idea.

Choose and add your first sprite.

[[[generic-scratch-sprite-from-library]]]
--- /task ---

Give your project a title that matches your theme. 

**generic-scratch-title with gif**

--- task ---
Copy your first sprite twice so you have three sprites which look the same.

**Add:scratch-copy&rename-sprite**

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Rename the sprites. For example, ChosenName1, ChosenName2, ChosenName3.

**Tip:** Naming and numbering your sprites for Same but different will be a good way for you, and others, to recognise which sprite is which as well as the order you may want them to show.
