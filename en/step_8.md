## Reflect on your project
How did you get on with your Looping sprites project? Is there anything you would do differently? 

Remind yourself what you have learned:

--- task ---
I can use if on edge, bounce inside a forever loop to make my sprite turn away from the edge of the stage
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can use a forever loop to make a sprite repeat code 
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can modify a costume in the paint editor
--- /task ---
--- task ---
My  project uses rotation styles to change how my sprite rotates
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I can use layers to make it look like some sprites are in front of others
--- /task ---
--- task ---
I found a bug in my code and fixed it
--- /task ---

Demonstrating these skills will contribute to the [Scratch Beginner]() and [Citizen Maker]() badges. 

You can go back and improve your project whenever you have time. 

If you have a Scratch account and have shared your Looping sprites project, keep an eye out for comments that others may make about your creation. Feedback is a great way to reflect on your work. Ignore any comments which are negative or irrelevant.

Share your project

If you are in a club, why not demonstrate your project to friends and peers?

If you are at home, try the project out with your family. 

If you have a Scratch account you can share your project through Scratch. Then you can send a link to people you know and the whole Scratch community will be able to find your project and try it out.

Change the new sprite's costume or edit the costume with the paint editor so that it looks different from your first sprite.

Think about how this sprite will be different to the first sprite. 

How big should the sprite be? 
Which direction will it point in?

Will the sprite appear behind or in front or other sprites?
