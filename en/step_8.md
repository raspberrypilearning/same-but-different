## Create sprites 2 and 3 (as well as the distractor sprite 4)

--- task ---

Duplicate your first sprite twice to create the starting point for sprites 2 and 3.

Rename sprites 2 and 3.

**Tip:** Always title sprites and costume with easy to remember names.

The two new sprites only need the original first costume. Delete the other costumes so all the sprites' first costume is exactly the same.

Make sure you have selected the Costume tab in the correct sprite that you want to change.

Under `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} keep the following `go to`{:class="block3motion"} block. Remember to change their starting position so each sprite starts in a different possition on the stage:
```blocks3
go to x: () y: () :: motion
```

The sprites need to be the same size as each other. What size should the sprites be? Making them smaller or bigger means they will look more in proportion in relation to the Backdrop. Add the following block and change the value of each sprite.

```blocks3
set size to () %` :: looks
```

For sprites 2 and 3 ONLY delete the remainder of the code under `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} 

To do thiss, make sure you have selected the Code tab in the correct sprite.
